# Supergen

Supergen is a very simple binary application which takes three values:
1. A username, in the form of a --username value in the command line.
2. A password, in the form of a --password value in the command line.
3. A database url, in the form of an environment variable by the name "SUPERGEN_DB_URL".

This application was created with a single use purpose in mind. While I'm not opposed to developing it further, I personally have no need to do so at present.
